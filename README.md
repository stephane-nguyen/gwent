# gwent


Each player has a number of cards symbolizing a unit belonging to one of the three following categories: hand-to-hand, ranged combat, and siege. 
Each card has a certain power. 

During a round, each player takes turns playing. During his turn, the player may choose a card from his deck and place it on the central board, depending on the category to which that card belongs. 


If it is a close combat unit, it goes in front. 

If it is a ranged combat unit, it stays in the center. 

If it is a siege unit, it is in the background. He can also skip his turn. 

When a player passes his turn or has no more cards to play, points are counted by comparing the sum of the powers of the cards placed on the table by player 1 with the sum of the powers of the cards placed by player 2 (here, we have taken some liberties with the real rules of Gwent, for simplicity). The player whose cards have the most accumulated power wins the round. Whoever wins 2 rounds wins the game (Note that there is a possibility of a tie or a draw).
